# Pokémon Type Calculator

Pokémon Type Calculator helps you figure out offense/defense matchups for Pokémon.

## Project origin

This project started as a clone of https://github.com/wavebeem/pkmn.help. Please view this original project to see continued development that will get published to https://pkmn.help/.

## Repository purpose

### Technical learning

In order to grow my software development skills, I needed an opportunity to learn more about React, an increasingly popular front-end web interface library. By cloning a project behind a website that I frequently visit, I will be able to break things down and build them back up in order to improve my skills in these areas.

### Video game strategy

The https://pkmn.help/ website is one that I use very often while playing Pokémon games.

At the time of writing, I am currently playing Pokémon Alpha Sapphire, and I got too used to how Pokémon Shield and Pokémon Ultra Sun just told me which moves would be super effective and which ones would not be very effective. I would think, by now, I should have some of the type matchups memorized, but I found myself constantly going to https://pkmn.help/ in order to search for a given Pokémon to determine which moves work the best. If I want to evolve a Pokémon and cannot remember if it is a "level up" kind or a "give it this item" kind or something else, I will also need to have Bulbapedia open so I can confirm as I go.

Making a custom version of this website locally can help me see some of the features that would really help me as I play the games.
